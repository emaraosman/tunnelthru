GETTING THE APPLICATION RUNNING on IOS Simulator:

Before doing this make sure to have xcode installed and fully updated.

Clone it, bundle install it, then run 'rails db:create'/ 'rails db:migrate'. Then you can run 'rails server'. Now that rails server is running, open new terminal and head over to client folder, run 'yarn install', then 'react-native run-ios'.
